#### Description
Welcome to Tetris in Python! This project is an implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python and Pygame. Below, you will find all the project information.

#### Game Overview
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov. The game has been ported in countless versions and this project aims to bring the classic Tetris experience to life using Python and the Pygame library.

In this version of Tetris, the player controls pieces called "tetrominoes," which are shapes made up of four square blocks each. These pieces fall across the playing field and the player must move and rotate them to fit them into complete rows. When a row is completed, it disappears and the player earns points. The game can be sped up by making it more difficult.
